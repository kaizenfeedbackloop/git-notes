Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both

To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!

I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
